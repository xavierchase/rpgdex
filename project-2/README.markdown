# project 2 

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/scbgxc/pen/XWMxrmo](https://codepen.io/scbgxc/pen/XWMxrmo).

My attempt to make an interactive Pokedex.

It is completely drawn by SCSS. Voice feature is made using ResponsiveVoice.

You can search up to 893 Pokemons. (Because the API only have information for 893 Pokemons at the moment)

I know it can be improved here and there. But it's still... something :D

Hope you like it. I really welcome feedback too!
